## Useful scripts
Declaring and defining Classes in C++ might be a tedious task. That's why I have created these 2 scripts.
### The createFolder creates a folder with 3 files containing the universal content for each case. 
  * 1 main bracket 
  * 2 Class.hpp
  * 3 Class.cpp
  * usage: createclass.sh <folder_name> <class_name>
### The createclass, creates 2 files
  * 1 Class.hpp
  * 2 Class.cpp
  * usage: createclass.sh <class_name>
### Ubuntu install
  * install essential programs in a fresh Ubuntu copy
### Docker install
  * standard docker installation as recommended in docker's guide
